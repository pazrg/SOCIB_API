# What are SOCIB data-products?

SOCIB data-products wrapp data-sources sharing the same context into one single entity. This context can represent campaings (i.e CANALES), projects (i.e ABACUS, ["gliding turtles"](http://www.socib.eu/?seccion=siasDivision&facility=oceanographic-turtles)), operations (maintenance) etc. A certain SOCIB data-product can be composed then by a single data-source (i.e such data-source was deployed lonely) or serveral (i.e data-sources deployed during the same event). 

Examples of a multiplatform product (glider + tagged turtles) below:

SOCIB data-products constitute the second level of abstraction build over the data-sources, being the first one the so-called SOCIB data-products.

# Who is addressed to?

Anyone interested in exploring SOCIB data archiving can use the API, that is, researchers for finding the data that better suit their study-cases or developers interested in integrating SOCIB data on its products.
